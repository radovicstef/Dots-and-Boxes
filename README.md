# Dots & Boxes - Inteligent System Project

The aims of this project were to learn basic artificial intelligence concepts and to apply this knowledge in making a smart computer game opponent.
The game is called 'Dots and Boxes' and is a well-known board game.
There are three different heuristics for choosing the best next move, depending on the level that is beeing chosen.

• Easy - the game solver opponent chooses lines in random order. <br>
• Medium - the game solver opponent chooses lines using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, with a difference in a score as a heuristic function. <br>
• Hard - the game solver opponent chooses lines using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, with an optimized heuristic function that counts the number of chains. <br>

It is written in Java and uses JavaSwing for visual interpretation.
